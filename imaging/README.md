### Source Extractor 
Installation and use instructions:

To install source extractor, I used:
```brew install sextractor```

This installs source extractor but does not correctly include some of the default files, like the convolutional filter and parameter files. I've included these in this directory with the proper settings for running on SDSS files.

First, follow the instructions on this website for installation: https://sextractor.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Installing.html

I went to the Github repo and downloaded the .zip file (https://github.com/astromatic/sextractor).
