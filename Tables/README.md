This is the folder for storing all of the tables. <img src="images_for_github/tiny_table.png" alt="pizza" width="100">

Right now, on github, I only have room to share the LDA_merged_.... tables, which include all of the predictor values for the simulated galaxies. 

Note that this includes both imaging and kinematic predictors. There's code for how to load up these tables and use them to create the LDA classification in the MergerMonger.py function load_LDA_from_simulation. 

I'm planning on providing the table with all SDSS IDs, RAs, and Dec, the table with predictor values for all SDSS galaxies, and the table with probability values for all SDSS galaxies via the journal.
